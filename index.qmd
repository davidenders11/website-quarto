## About Me

![](pictures/headshot.jpg){fig-align="left" width="300"}

I'm a fourth year student at Claremont McKenna College, majoring in computer science at Harvey Mudd College. I love to build and learn new things, and am currently recruiting for software engineering roles. 

I have work experience in embedded software engineering in the automotive space and full-stack web development, and have informal or academic experience in machine learning, compiler and programming language design, building AI-powered tools, and more. I also am participating in neural networks research, using generative models for climate prediction purposes.

Some other interests of mine are woodworking and welding, listening to and making music, board sports (snowboard, surf, skate), and travelling.
